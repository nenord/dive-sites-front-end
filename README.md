# Front-end SSR: Crowdsourced dive sites app

A **work in progress** example: http://dives.nenoapps.tk/

A front end for https://github.com/nenord/dive-sites-api.

Built using Sapper/Svelte

Deployed via Dokku running on Google Cloud VM.

## Roadmap
Add users and login to track who created the app

Edit sites â€“ only if a user created the site (or user is Admin)

Add images to sites and display them on sites pages.
